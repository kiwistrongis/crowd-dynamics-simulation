  A simulation of crowd dynamics.

This project uses some libraries. These libraries should be in the libs/ folder.
 * Ini4J : ini4j.sourceforge.net/download.html
 * Json Simple : code.google.com/p/json-simple/downloads/list
 * osp-numerics : more complicated, ask me for it.

Run with any of the following, depending on your platform and inclination:
 - ./crowd [data/whatever.ini]
 - .\crowd.bat 
 - java -cp bin:libs/* Driver [data/whatever.ini]
